# *Objective-*

### *Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and start your car's engine using RF signals.*

# *Description-*

### **This project describes about the Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.** 

### **The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically**

### *Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.* 

### *1.	 RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver.* 
### *Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated* 
### *Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE* 
### *2.	 RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally.* 
### *3.	RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.* 


# *Features-*
