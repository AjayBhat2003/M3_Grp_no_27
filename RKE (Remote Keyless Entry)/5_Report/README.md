### 1.Details about Bicom System 
### ->Description
### **This project describes about the Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.** 

### **The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically**

### *Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.* 

### *1.	 RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver.* 
### *Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated* 
### *Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE* 
### *2.	 RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally.* 
### *3.	RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.* 

### ->Features

### *1. Print lock â€“ (Blue switch on- All led on at the same time)*

### *2. Print unlock - (Blue switch press two times- All led off at the same time)*

### *3. Print alarm activation/deactivation - (Blue switch press three times- All led on in clockwise manner)*

### *4. Print approach light - (Blue switch press four times- All led on in anti-clockwise manner)*

### ->SWOT Analysis
### Strength
- Remote Keyless car offer a greater challenge to potential thieves.
- The convenience of a keyless lock makes it easier to get inside your house safely and quickly everytime.
### Weakness
- Tendency to loose your key fob where a traditional car could be more easily accessible in these irritating situations.
- Keyless entry can cost a good bit.
### Threats
- One of the threat of keyless entry is "eavesdropping" where signal sent to a haker when driver presses their key fob to unlock the car.
### Opportunities
- The demand for Keyless entry system is directly influenced by the automotive production and sales activities across the globe.

### ->4W'S & 1H
### Who
- Any person can operate it easily.
### What
- Sensor that detects remote keyless key fob within certain range of vehicle.
### When
- To remotely lock, unlock and start your vehicles enginne using RF signals.
### Where
- It is found in modern vehicles and widely used in automobiles.
### How 
- Developed using microcontroller and implemented it.
