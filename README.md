## RKE System

### **This project describes about the Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.** 

### *Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.* 

### *1.	 RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver.* 
### *Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated* 
### *Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE* 
### *2.	 RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally.* 
### *3.	RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.* 


##  Bicom System

### A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system.
